## HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

- **HTML pages** - Four HTML pages: home (login), focus (select project and run timer), hours (view project hours and others hours), and about.
- **Links** - The login page automatically links to the focus page.
- **Text** - Text labels of each project and a description of the website on the about page
- **Images** - I didn't see the need for images so I didn't include any
- **Login** - Input boxes and submit button for login.
- **Input** - input buttons to add a project, a drop down menu to select a project, and buttons to control the timer.
- **Database** - The user's projects and hours represent data pulled from the database.
- **WebSocket** - The recent community hours represent websocket data

## CSS deliverable

For this deliverable I properly styled the application into its final appearance.

- **Header, footer, and main content body** - I added background colors that fit my color scheme
- **Navigation elements** - I dropped the underlines and changed the color for anchor elements.
- **Responsive to window resizing** - My website resizes effectively to fit different devices
- **Application elements** - Used good contrast and whitespace, buttons, forms, and tables properly styled
- **Application text content** - Consistent fonts

## Javascript deliverable

For this deliverable I implemented Javascript so the website works for a single user and time.

- **login** The login button automatically takes the user to the focus page
- **timer** The timer keeps track of time and presents it in an hours/minutes/seconds format
- **projects** The website keeps track of a list of projects the user inputs and their associated times and displays them in a table
- **websocket** user to user interaction will be supported on the hours page, where the most recent community hours and projects are displayed

## Service deliverable

For this deliverable I added backend endpoints that receives user data and displays it to other users.

- **Node.js and Express** - done!
- **Static middleware for frontend** - done!
- **Calls to third party endpoints** - I implemented a call to a third party API for daily cat facts and displayed the facts on my about page
- **Backend service endpoints** - Recieves information about users' projects and stores it in an array
- **Frontend calls service endpoints** - Using the fetch function, I sent the information to the back end and retrieved it to display on the hours page.
